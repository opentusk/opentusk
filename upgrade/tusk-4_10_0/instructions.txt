# Student needs to request an assessor who is not yet in TUSK system.
# This release is to put back the other assessor but with an enhanced feature.
# We want to keep data in a more meaningful fashion.  An email address, firstname, lastname are required when student adds a new assesor.
# It will add the assessor to user table with an internal user_id (firstinitiallastname_nt), then link the assessor to the course, teaching_site and time period.
# Student then can request this assessor

# *** IMPORTANT *** 
# We also re-organize columns in hsdb4.user table.
# There will be a user table lock while executing the below sql. This process may take a few minutes depending on how big your user table is.
# Please make sure to run it in low traffic or bring the web server(s) down if necessary. You may test it on your test server if your test dataset is similar to prod.
