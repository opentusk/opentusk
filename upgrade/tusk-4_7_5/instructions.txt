*******This is NOT NECESSARY for a default weekly schedule starting on Monday and ending
on Friday.*******

To have a non-standard schedule format for a particular school add the following
in your tusk.conf file for that particular school's entry:

		"Schedule"    : {
		    "StartDay"             :  "Mon",
		    "EndDay"               :  "Sun"
		}

Where the "StartDay" should have the first three letters of the day of the week 
that you want to start your schedule on, and, 
the "Endday" should have the first three letters of the day of the week that you 
want to start your schedule on.
