We will be adding a constraint to the quiz_response table to prevent duplicate entries at the database level. 
It is recommended to back up the quiz_response table in the TUSK database before going ahead.

After backing up quiz_response, run the following query:

> SELECT quiz_result_id, GROUP_CONCAT(link_id) FROM quiz_response GROUP BY link_id, quiz_result_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

This should give you a list of problematic entries (i.e. entries with duplicates) in the quiz_response database.

Then you can go ahead with individually looking at each pair (or more) of duplicate entries:

> SELECT * FROM quiz_response WHERE quiz_result_id = <quiz_id> and link_id = <link_id>;

and then deleting the undesired ones. If two entries are same (besides the quiz_response_id) you can delete either, if they are different then delete the one 

without the 'graded_flag'. Command to delete:

> DELETE FROM quiz_response WHERE quiz_response_id = <quiz_response_id>;

Once there are no duplicate entries for the quiz_result_id/link_id pair in the quiz_response table you can go ahead in creating the constraint:

>  ALTER TABLE quiz_response ADD UNIQUE unique_quiz_index (quiz_result_id, link_id);
