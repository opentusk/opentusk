Upgrade instructions for course competencies:

Database:

Create a backup of exiting data by dumping data from competency_type table and competency_relationship table:

> mysqldump tusk competency_type > competency_type.sql
> mysqldump tusk competency_relationship > competency_relationship.sql

Run included sql script course.sql:

> mysql tusk < course.sql

Data migration:

Run the included perl script default_user_types to generate the default user competency types for each school:
(Note: This needs to be run BEFORE the course_objective_migration.pl file)

> perl default_user_types.pl


Run the included perl script course_objective_migration.pl to migrate data from the older course_objectives tables to the competency table:
(Note: This needs to be run AFTER the default_user_types.pl file)
