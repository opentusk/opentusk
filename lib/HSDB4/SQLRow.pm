=head1 NAME

B<HSDB4::SQLRow> - Virtual class for manipulating entries in HSDB4 tables

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A virtual class intended to be subclassed.  Used to get retrieve individual rows from HSDB4 tables and perform generic manipulations on them.  Also intended to provide a standard set of methods for dealing with table rows to take advantage of polymorphism.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # A subclass of SQLRow
    package HSDB4::SQLRow::Subclass; 
    use HSDB4::SQLRow;
    @ISA = qw(SQLRow Exporter);

    # Set the table properties
    my $tablename         = 'tablename';
    my $primary_key_field = 'id_field';
    my @fields =       qw(id_field field1 num_field2 body_field ...
			  );
    my %numeric_fields = qw(num_field2 => 1
			    );
    my %blob_fields =    (body_field => 1
			  );

    # Create a cache
    my %cache = ();
    
    # Make a constructor that calls the SQLRow constructor
    sub new {
	# Find out what class we are
	my $class = shift;
	$class = ref $class || $class;
	# Call the super-class's constructor and give it all the values
	my $self = 
	    $class->SUPER::new ( _tablename => $tablename,
				 _fields => \@fields,
				 _blob_fields => \%blob_fields,
				 _numeric_fields => \%numeric_fields,
				 _primary_key_field => $primary_key_field,
				 _cache => \%cache,
				 _school => $school,
				 @_);
	# Finish initialization...
	...
	return $self;
    }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Table Methods

B<table()> returns the name of the table in the database definition.

B<primary_key_field()> returns the name of the field which is the
primary key.

B<is_field_numeric()> returns TRUE if the field named in the argument
should be sorted numerically rather than lexically.

B<is_field_blob()> returns TRUE if the field named in the argument is
a BLOB field that should not be returned as a matter of course.

B<fields()> returns the list of fields in the table.

B<non_blob_fields()> returns the list of fields in the table which are
not BLOB (should be returns as a matter of course).

B<get_sql_table()> returns a B<HSDB4::SQLTable> object representation
of the table with the appropriate table name and non-BLOB field list.

=head2 Constructor

B<new()> intended to be used as the default creation tool for
subclasses.  It is required that subclasses which override it still
call it during the override.  Subclasses need to pass the
C<_tablename>, C<primary_key_field>, C<_fields>, C<_numeric_fields>,
C<_blob_fields>, and C<_cache> variables to B<HSDB4::SQLRow::new> so
that other B<SQLRow> functions can work properly.  B<new()> returns a
blank object which can then have data read into it in other ways.

=head2 Accessors

B<primary_key()> returns the value in the primary key field for a
particular row object. Also can be used to set it.

B<id()> returns a concatanation of the table name and the primary key
to be used as a unique identified for the row across all tables.

B<field_value()>

    $val = $rowobj->field_value ('field1');
    $rowobj->field_value ('field1', $newval);

Used to get or set the values in the object representations of the row.

B<get_field_values()> gets a the values for the fields named in the
arguments.

B<set_field_values()> is called with C<(key =E<gt> 'value')> pairs,
and it used to set all of the field/value pairs for a row object.

B<set_aux_info()> is called with C<(key =E<gt> 'value')> and is used
to set the values is a separate sub-hash which stores context
information, specifically information about from where an object is
linked.

B<aux_info()> is called with the name of C<aux_info> fields. It
returns the value of that C<aux_info> field, if it is set.

B<clear_aux_info()> clears all of the auxiliary information for a row.

=head2 Database Interaction

B<lookup_conditions()>

    @objs = HSDB4::SQLRow::Subclass->lookup_conditions ('OR',
							'field1=val',
							'field2=val');

Performs a lookup on a table based on the conditions given as
arguments and returns appropriate objects in a list.  The arguments to
the list are just like the C<-conditions> parameter to the
B<HSDB4::SQLSelect::new()> method.

B<lookup_key()> can be used to fill in the values an I<existing>
B<SQLRow> object of a particular B<SQLRow> subclass from the database
(or the cache) by the table's primary key, given as an argument.

B<lookup_all()> returns a big list of objects of the type which are
all of those in the databse.

B<lookup_fields()> returns the value of a particular set of fields for
a particular row object.

B<lookup_path()> converts the extra path information in a URI into a
primary key query for an object.

B<save()> takes the values of the object which have changed since its
initialization and saves them back to the database in using an
C<UPDATE> SQL command.  The arguments are the username/password to be
given for connecting to the database for this purpose; if they are not
given, it is assumed to be the default user, who might not have
sufficient permission. If the primary key is not set, then a C<INSERT>
command is used instead, and the C<mysql_insertid> is used to set the
primary key of the object.

B<save_replace()> saves an object where its primary key has been set
already. It will replace that value if it's already in the database.

=head2 Other Input Methods

B<in_xml()> is not yet implemented.  Most of it should be implemented
at the subclass level.  B<in_xml()> will probably eventually figure
out what the root level element is and create appropriate XML objects
and parse them.  Most of the business should probably be implemented
at the subclass level.

B<in_fdat_hash()> is not yet implemented, and should also probably be
implemented at the subclass level.

=head2 Output Methods

B<is_user_authorized()> takes a user name as an argument and decides
whether the named user is authorized to view the object.

B<out_url()> returns the URL to get to the primary display of the
object, as defined in B<HSDB4::Constants>.

B<out_edit_url()> returns a URL to an editable version of the page, as
defined in B<HSDB4::Constants>.

B<out_html_div()> returns a nicely formatted chunk of HTML,
appropriate for including in a page, wrapped in C<E<lt>DIVE<gt>> tags.

B<out_xml()> should be implemented at the subclass level.

B<out_html_row()> should be implemented by each subclass. The
overridden method should return a four-column HTML row for a summary
display.  (Note: C<COLSPAN=2> is OK, of course.)

B<out_label> should be overridden by the subclss and return a nice
name for the object

B<out_abbrev> should be overridden by the subclass and return a nice
abbreviation for the object.

B<out_html_label> uses the B<out_label()> method and returns the label wrapped in an HTML C<E<lt>A HREF="..."E<gt>> tag with the url of the object.

B<out_html_abbrev> is the same as C<out_html_label()>, but uses the
abbreviation rather than the full name.
