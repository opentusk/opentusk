do_usage() {
cat <<+

This script requires two parameters - a start date and an end
date. Like so:

tusk_change_log [date] [date]

e.g.

tusk_change_log 01/20/04 06/04/04

The output will go to a file with a path of:

$HOME/$OUTFILE

+
exit;

}

START=$1;
END=$2;
OUTFILE=TuskChanges;
PWD=`pwd`


if [ "$START" = "" ]
then
   do_usage
fi
if [ "$END" = "" ]
then
   do_usage
fi

if [ "$HOME" != "$PWD" ]
then
	chdir $HOME
fi

/usr/local/tusk/current/bin/cvs2cl.pl -f $OUTFILE -Ftrunk -l"-d'$START<$END'" apache hsdb_tool

chdir $PWD
