Project:
OpenTUSK, an enterprise content, course, learning, knowledge, and curriculum management system focused on health sciences education.

Prerequisites:
* CENTOS 7
* GIT  (if needed, sudo yum install -y git)

Installation
0) Make sure your account has sudo access. Most of bash scripts run as tusk user or root. Though we will change owner(chown) all the files to tusk user. If not on a sudo-er list, from a root user, run "usermod -a -G wheel <youruserid>"

1) Prepare location where TUSK will be.
> sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/tusk

2) Clone OpenTUSK.
> cd /usr/local/tusk
> sudo git clone git://github.com/opentusk/opentusk.git
> sudo ln -s opentusk current

3) Copy and modify your install configuration.
> cp /usr/local/tusk/current/install/templates/conf/tusk/tusk_install.yml /usr/local/tusk/conf
Make sure you check the values in your tusk_install.conf before running the install script.

4) Run install script. This will (a) create system accounts eg tusk, apache and (b) install custom perl
> source ./tusk_install_run
